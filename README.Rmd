### Actions on rows

With the data.table syntax, we describe and perform actions on rows, such as sorting or subsetting data, as `i` in `dt[i]`.

<details>
<summary>Sorting</summary>

A data.table that has been sorted on one or more variables, in ascending or descending order, can be returned by using the `order()` function. 


- Sort by a single variable in _ascending_ order: `dt[order(x)]`
- Sort by a single variable in _descending_ order: `dt[order(-x)]`
- Sort by a _multiple_ variables: `dt[order(x, y, z)]`

```{r}
# Example: sort dt_starwars from shortest to tallest character
dt_starwars[order(height)]
```

</details>


<details><summary>Subset by numerical index</summary>

The second common action to be performed is subsetting data &mdash; reducing a dataset to a set of observations that meet a criteria. That criteria might be as simple as position. For example, you could take an ordered dataset and return the top five observations. This is done by passing a vector of integers as `i`. Vectors are the basic data structure in R and are created using the concatenate function, `c()` &mdash; e.g. `c(1, 2, 3)`. Individual numbers can also be passed without the `c()` function, while a sequence of integers can also be generated using the `:` operator (and the `c()` function omitted), e.g. `1:3` is equivalent to `c(1, 2, 3)`.

- Return the top row: `dt[1]`
- Return the top three rows: `dt[1:3]`
- Return the first, fifth and ninth rows: `dt[c(1, 5, 9)]`
- Return the last row: `dt[nrow(dt)]`

```{r}
# Example: return the top five rows
dt_starwars[1:5]
```


The last example, using `nrow()` to return the last row can be rewritten to use one of data.tables special characters. There are a few useful special characters and I will cover these more later. For now, the value returned by `nrow(dt)` is equal to `.N`, so you can rewrite the last expression as:

- Return the last row using the `.N` special character: `dt[.N]`

```{r}
# Example: return the last row
dt_starwars[.N]
```


<strong>Chaining</strong>

Finally, you may have sorted a data.table to see which observations are the top *n*, e.g. the five tallest characters. You can do this by first storing the sorted table in the working environment as `dt_starwars_sorted <- dt_starwars[order(-height)]`. But you can also avoid storing variables unnecessarily by acting directly on the returned data.table, using something called __chaining__. This allows multiple data.table statements to be joined together and executed in sequence to give a single return. It is done by adding more square braces &mdash; `dt[][][]...[]`.

- Return the top five sorted observations: `dt[order(x)][1:5]`

```{r}
# Example: return the five tallest characters
dt_starwars[order(-height)][1:5]
```

</details>


<details><summary>Subset by condition</summary>

Subsets can also be returned to give the observations that meet a certain logical criteria. For example, all characters over 200 cm tall, or all characters from Naboo. Such conditional subsetting is done using logical operators. In R, the key logical operators are:

- `==` equal to
- `!=` not equal to
- `<` less than
- `>` greater than
- `<=` less than or equal to
- `>=` greater than or equal to
- `%in%` value is in a vector

All of the above require values either side of the operator (e.g. `3 > 4`), and will return one or more logical values &mdash; `TRUE` or `FALSE`. Other useful operators and functions for conditional subsetting are:

- `&` to join logical operations like "and" so `TRUE` is returned if both conditions are met
- `|` to join logical operations like "or" so `TRUE` is returned if either condition is met
- `(` and `)` to set the order of operations, just like math
- `grepl()` to test if a pattern occurs in a value

With these, you can now return data to meet a certain criteria:

- Return rows where observed value is equal to a criteria: `dt[x==a]`
- Return rows where observed value is less than a criteria: `dt[x<a]`
- Return rows where observed value is one of several criteria: `dt[x %in% c(a, b, c)]`
- Return rows where observed value is between two values: `dt[x>5 & x<=10]`

```{r}
# Exmaple: return all characters under 180 cm tall from Naboo and Tatooine 
dt_starwars[height<180 & homeworld %in% c('Naboo', 'Tatooine')]
```
</details>

#### Summary of `dt[i]`

- Actions on rows are performed as `i` in `dt[i]`
- This is useful for returning sorted data.tables and data.tables containing a subset of the original data
- Logical operators can be used to subset to data meeting a certain criteria

### To add:

- select; `dt[, j]`, `.SD`
- assignment
- conditional assignment (`dt[, ifelse(...)]` and `dt[i, j]`)
- compute; `x(j)`
- group by; `by` and `keyby`
- special characters; `.SD, .N, .I ...`
- chaining
